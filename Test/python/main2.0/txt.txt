The environmental pollution is worse and worse today. Many trees are cut down, and 
water and air are polluted. As a student I try to have a low -carbon life to save energy and 
reduce pollution.  
Firstly, I often walk to school. It can reduce air pollution. Secondly, I always turn off the 
lights and fans when leaving the classroom. Thirdly, I always make full use of paper and other 
school things and never waste water.  
I wish more students to join me and make the earth more and more beautiful.
